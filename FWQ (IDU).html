    <div class="faq-container">
  <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer1.1')">Question 1. What is a terrestrial ecosystem?</div>
  <div class="answer" id="answer1.1">A terrestrial ecosystem refers to a land-based ecosystem that includes all the living organisms and their interactions with the physical environment, such as soil, water, and air. Examples include forests, grasslands, deserts, and tundra.
  </div>
  <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer1.2')">Question 2. How do plants contribute to terrestrial ecosystems?
  </div>
  <div class="answer" id="answer1.2">Answer: Plants play a crucial role in terrestrial ecosystems by converting sunlight into energy through photosynthesis. They provide habitat and food for various organisms, contribute to oxygen production, and help regulate the climate by absorbing carbon dioxide.
    <br>
    </div>
    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer1.3')">Question 3. What is the importance of biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems?
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer1.3">Answer: Biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems refers to the variety of plant and animal species present. It is essential for ecosystem stability and resilience. Diverse ecosystems are more capable of adapting to environmental changes, providing ecosystem services like pollination, water purification, and nutrient cycling.
    <br>
    </div>
    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer1.4')">Question 4. How are human activities impacting terrestrial ecosystems?
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer1.4">Answer: Human activities, such as deforestation, urbanization, and agriculture, can have detrimental effects on terrestrial ecosystems. Loss of habitat, pollution, and climate change are significant threats. Conservation efforts, sustainable land management, and reforestation are important strategies to mitigate these impacts.
    </div>
    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer1.5')">Question 5. What role do decomposers play in terrestrial ecosystems?
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer1.5">Answer: Decomposers, such as bacteria, fungi, and detritivores, play a vital role in breaking down dead organic matter. This decomposition process releases nutrients back into the soil, facilitating nutrient cycling and supporting the growth of plants. Decomposers contribute to the overall health and sustainability of terrestrialÂ ecosystems.

<br>
<br>
<div class="faq-container">
  <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer2.1')">Question 1. What defines a desert ecosystem?</div>
  <div class="answer" id="answer2.1">A desert ecosystem is characterized by low precipitation levels, often receiving less than 250 millimeters (10 inches) of rainfall annually. These regions typically have arid or semi-arid climates, resulting in unique adaptations of flora and fauna to conserve water.
  </div>
  <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer2.2')">Question 2. Where are deserts located around the world?
  </div>
  <div class="answer" id="answer2.2">Answer: Deserts are found on every continent. Examples include the Sahara Desert in Africa, the Sonoran Desert in North America, the Atacama Desert in South America, the Arabian Desert in Asia, and the Australian Outback. Despite their diverse locations, deserts share common characteristics such as low rainfall and high temperatures.
    <br>
    </div>
    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer2.3')">Question 3. How do plants and animals adapt to the harsh conditions of deserts?
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer2.3">Answer: Desert flora and fauna have developed various adaptations to survive in extreme conditions. Plants may have deep root systems, reduced leaves, or succulent tissues to store water. Animals often exhibit behaviors like nocturnal activity to avoid daytime heat, burrowing for shelter, and efficient water conservation mechanisms.
    <br>
    </div>
    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer2.4')">Question 4. What is unique about desert biodiversity?
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer2.4">Answer: Desert ecosystems, though seemingly inhospitable, harbor unique biodiversity. Many desert species have evolved specific adaptations to cope with limited water resources and temperature extremes. Endangered species such as the desert tortoise and various cacti are integral to desert ecosystems.
    </div>
    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer2.5')">Question 5. How are desert ecosystems impacted by human activities?
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer2.5">Answer: Human activities, including agriculture, urbanization, and climate change, can have significant impacts on desert ecosystems. Overgrazing by livestock, water extraction, and habitat destruction can disrupt the delicate balance of desert ecosystems, leading to soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and potential desertification. Conservation efforts are crucial to mitigateÂ theseÂ effects.

<br>
<br>
<div class="faq-container">
  <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer3.1')">Question 1. What is a temperate forest?</div>
  <div class="answer" id="answer3.1">A temperate forest is a biome characterized by moderate climate conditions, with distinct seasons including warm summers and cold winters. These forests are found in regions with four distinct seasons and moderate precipitation.
  </div>
  <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer3.2')">Question 2. Where are temperate forests located?
  </div>
  <div class="answer" id="answer3.2">Answer: Temperate forests are widespread and can be found in both hemispheres. Examples include the deciduous forests of North America, Europe, and Asia in the Northern Hemisphere, as well as the temperate rainforests in parts of Chile, New Zealand, and Australia in the Southern Hemisphere.
    <br>
    </div>
    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer3.3')">Question 3. What types of trees are common in temperate forests?
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer3.3">Answer:  Deciduous trees, such as oak, maple, and beech, are common in temperate forests. These trees shed their leaves in the fall. Coniferous trees, like pine and spruce, may also be present, providing a mix of broadleaf and needle-leaf vegetation.
    <br>
    </div>
    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer3.4')">Question 4. What is the role of temperate forests in biodiversity conservation?
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer3.4">Answer: Temperate forests are important for biodiversity, supporting a wide range of plant and animal species. These ecosystems contribute to global biodiversity by providing habitats for various organisms, including mammals, birds, insects, and fungi.
    </div>
    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer3.5')">Question 5. How are temperate forests affected by climate change?
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer3.5">Answer: Climate change poses threats to temperate forests, impacting temperature and precipitation patterns. Shifts in these environmental conditions can affect the distribution of tree species, alter ecosystems, and potentially lead to changes in biodiversity and the overall health of temperate forestÂ ecosystems.
