    <div class="faq-container">
  <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer1.1')">Question 1. What is a terrestrial ecosystem?</div>
  <div class="answer" id="answer1.1">A terrestrial ecosystem refers to a land-based ecosystem that includes all the living organisms and their interactions with the physical environment, such as soil, water, and air. Examples include forests, grasslands, deserts, and tundra.
  </div>
  <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer1.2')">Question 2. How do plants contribute to terrestrial ecosystems?
  </div>
  <div class="answer" id="answer1.2">Answer: Plants play a crucial role in terrestrial ecosystems by converting sunlight into energy through photosynthesis. They provide habitat and food for various organisms, contribute to oxygen production, and help regulate the climate by absorbing carbon dioxide.
    <br>
    </div>
    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer1.3')">Question 3. What is the importance of biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems?
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer1.3">Answer: Biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems refers to the variety of plant and animal species present. It is essential for ecosystem stability and resilience. Diverse ecosystems are more capable of adapting to environmental changes, providing ecosystem services like pollination, water purification, and nutrient cycling.
    <br>
    </div>
    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer1.4')">Question 4. How are human activities impacting terrestrial ecosystems?
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer1.4">Answer: Human activities, such as deforestation, urbanization, and agriculture, can have detrimental effects on terrestrial ecosystems. Loss of habitat, pollution, and climate change are significant threats. Conservation efforts, sustainable land management, and reforestation are important strategies to mitigate these impacts.
    </div>
    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer1.5')">Question 5. What role do decomposers play in terrestrial ecosystems?
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer1.5">Answer: Decomposers, such as bacteria, fungi, and detritivores, play a vital role in breaking down dead organic matter. This decomposition process releases nutrients back into the soil, facilitating nutrient cycling and supporting the growth of plants. Decomposers contribute to the overall health and sustainability of terrestrialÂ ecosystems.

<br>
<br>
<div class="faq-container">
  <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer2.1')">Question 1. What defines a desert ecosystem?</div>
  <div class="answer" id="answer2.1">A desert ecosystem is characterized by low precipitation levels, often receiving less than 250 millimeters (10 inches) of rainfall annually. These regions typically have arid or semi-arid climates, resulting in unique adaptations of flora and fauna to conserve water.
  </div>
  <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer2.2')">Question 2. Where are deserts located around the world?
  </div>
  <div class="answer" id="answer2.2">Answer: Deserts are found on every continent. Examples include the Sahara Desert in Africa, the Sonoran Desert in North America, the Atacama Desert in South America, the Arabian Desert in Asia, and the Australian Outback. Despite their diverse locations, deserts share common characteristics such as low rainfall and high temperatures.
    <br>
    </div>
    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer2.3')">Question 3. How do plants and animals adapt to the harsh conditions of deserts?
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer2.3">Answer: Desert flora and fauna have developed various adaptations to survive in extreme conditions. Plants may have deep root systems, reduced leaves, or succulent tissues to store water. Animals often exhibit behaviors like nocturnal activity to avoid daytime heat, burrowing for shelter, and efficient water conservation mechanisms.
    <br>
    </div>
    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer2.4')">Question 4. What is unique about desert biodiversity?
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer2.4">Answer: Desert ecosystems, though seemingly inhospitable, harbor unique biodiversity. Many desert species have evolved specific adaptations to cope with limited water resources and temperature extremes. Endangered species such as the desert tortoise and various cacti are integral to desert ecosystems.
    </div>
    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer2.5')">Question 5. How are desert ecosystems impacted by human activities?
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer2.5">Answer: Human activities, including agriculture, urbanization, and climate change, can have significant impacts on desert ecosystems. Overgrazing by livestock, water extraction, and habitat destruction can disrupt the delicate balance of desert ecosystems, leading to soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and potential desertification. Conservation efforts are crucial to mitigateÂ theseÂ effects.

    <br>
    </div>
    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer3.4')">Question 4. What are the main components of a forest ecosystem?
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer3.4">Answer: The main components of a forest ecosystem include biotic factors (living organisms such as trees, plants, animals, and microorganisms) and abiotic factors (non-living elements such as soil, water, sunlight, and climate). The interactions among these components determine the health and functioning of the ecosystem.
    </div>
    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer3.5')">Question 5. How can we conserve and sustainably manage forest ecosystems?
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer3.5">Answer: Conservation and sustainable management of forest ecosystems involve practices such as reforestation, afforestation, protected area designation, and responsible logging. Balancing human needs with ecological preservation, promoting sustainable forestry practices, and supporting initiatives that reduce deforestation are essential for the long-term health of forestÂ ecosystems.
